/*
Objects of this class represent Scroll-Bars which are displayed on screen if their update() and display() functions are called. 
The position of the Scroll-Bar (this.spos) can be accessed and then mapped onto another variable (the scale factor, and animation speed in this case)
This class was acquired from https://processing.org/examples/scrollbar.html, and then modified to provide additional features. The comments that were
included in this class by the author were removed, and the comments below reprents modifications made
